#!/bin/bash
#From the shell of a debiancontainer, install via the containerâ€™s package manager
#everything you need to compile C source code and push it onto a git repo
#(ofcourse, make sure before that the package manager and the packages already in the
#container are updated). For this exercise, you should only specify the commands
#to be run directly in the container.
#First I ran the command to install a debian
#docker run -it debian /bin/bash
#Then update, upgrade and finally install build-essential. 
apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install build-essential git vim
#Although vim is not integral to use git, it is integral to actually test the command.
